Purpose: Sample project showing Java calculator service with JsonRPC

The Java server does the Json encoding/decoding using Douglas Crockford's
JSON-Java library which you will find at:

https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java

The projects lib directory contains the classes for Crockford's JSON-Java
library in the file json.jar. The javadocs for Crockfords JSON-Java library
are in the doc directory.

The lib directory also contains the server as an executable jar file in the
file server.jar. The server is constructed as a threaded socket server that
receives http posts to which there has been attached a JsonRPC 2.0 method
call json object.

To run the server from a command line in the project directory execute:
java -jar lib/server.jar 8080

To test the server, there are sample curl commands that call each method
implemented by the server. The arithmetic operations add, subtract, multiply,
and divide all take two double arguments and return a double result. The
information method "whoAreYou" is parameterless and returns a string.

There is included a sample java client, that also uses Crockford's JSON-Java
library. The ant build.all builds the file: lib/client.jar which is also an
executable jar file.
